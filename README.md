- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zara-Batson
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things... mostly video games, anime, cars, and programming/computer related things. I love building both cars and computers and I love learning about both!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Several different languages, primarily C, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I am just a student that wants to share what she has done so far at the moment. Maybe once I graduate, I'll be more open to collab on things.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her/Hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a very weird individual lol
